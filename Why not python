Why not python?

Python is a great lang, but I don't prefer using it. 

def calc(x,y):
    return x*y
    
print(calc(2,3))   # prints 6
print(calc("2",3)) # prints 222

When things got complex, the risk of malfunction is getting higher and higher.
Script languages like PHP or JS can return different types from JSON since restful is not a contract-based communication. They also don't check the types. 
For example, a version change (in the DB server, HTTP server, etc.) procedure may cause a malfunction. 

Imagine using that in a payment system, or a robotic system.
