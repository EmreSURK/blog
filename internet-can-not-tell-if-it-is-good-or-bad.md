You can not learn if a tech is good or bad via blogs.
When you search for things on the internet, good things are everywhere. People use it, like it, and talk about it. That creates a bubble about the topic you search.
That means almost non of your search result is fair, everyone is including more or less influence.
How can you react to fair knowledge?
I don't know. Please let me know if you do.
Sincerely,
The guy who wants to learn everything.
